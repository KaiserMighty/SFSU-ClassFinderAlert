# SFSU Class Opening Alert
## Webscraper I made to alert me when a course I want to enroll in has an opening.
Requires BeautifulSoup, Selenium, and Chrome Driver (included in repo).  
You can adapt this tool to work for you by changing the setup variables as needed for your case.  
To find the `term`, simply search for your class on the SFSU Class Schedule, and check the URL for `term=`.  
You can leave class id empty if you want to be alerted of all openings, for any section.  
You should already know how to find your course and class id.
